This is my frequency counter for my C.S 1.2 class, this is a python project where there is a given sample word text and we have to seperate the words given into linked lists using a hash table functino that we have to come up with ourselves. There was given starter code to help us out and we had to fix a few bugs and have a custom hash function. The insert function i coudlnt get to work and this is a hash function using ascii numbers. This is a README added after the original submission for extra points. I spent some times trying to figure out the insert function and i couldnt do it. Any help would be appreaciated.
